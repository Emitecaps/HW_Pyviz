# In this real estate analysis, there are 2 main workbooks to work with. The 1st notebook is rental_analysis.ipnyb where the dashboard will be built. Once this is completed, it will all be copied into a dashboard code to create the final layout.

# The Rental Analysis will include:
## Housing Units Per Year
## Average Housing Costs in San Francisco Per Year
## Average Prices By Neighborhood
## Top 10 Most Expensive Neighborhoods
## Comparing Cost to Purchase Versus Rental Income
## Neighborhood Map
#This will prepare all of the code and analysis to copy over to the Dashboard.

# The Dashboard will include:
## Use the Panel library to build an interactive dashboard for all of the data visualizations

# Use the starter notebooks provided
# Upload these to Github
